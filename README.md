# Summer-Project

The file summer_project_main_code contains everything that was used in the report. You should be able to run the entire script. There is one section that is commented out as it has recently stopped working, and i can't seem to fix it. The whole program takes a while to run, though I have made efforts to reduce the work load, by decreasing the sizes of networks/ number of tests from the original report. Where this has occoured is expalined throughout. 

The file additional graphs, is some extra graphs that were used in the report but use none of the actual code, they were purley visual aids
